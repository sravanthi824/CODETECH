1. Introduction

The Advanced Calculator is a Java program designed to perform various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to input operands and select the desired operation from a menu. This documentation aims to explain the functionality of the calculator, its features, and how to use it effectively.

2. Features

Addition: Allows users to add two numbers together.
Subtraction: Enables users to subtract one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together.
Division: Divides one number by another, avoiding division by zero.
Exponentiation: Raises a base number to a specified exponent.
User-friendly interface: Presents users with a clear menu and prompts for input.
Error handling: Prevents division by zero and handles invalid user input gracefully.
Option to quit: Allows users to exit the calculator when finished.
3. Usage

To use the Advanced Calculator, follow these steps:

Run the program in a Java development environment or terminal.
The program will display a menu with options for different arithmetic operations.
Enter a number corresponding to the operation you wish to perform (1-6).
Depending on your choice, the program will prompt you to enter the required operands.
After entering the operands, the program will display the result of the operation.
If you choose the option to quit (6), the program will terminate.
4. Code Explanation

The code consists of a single Java class, AdvancedCalculator, which contains the main method and various helper methods for performing arithmetic operations. Here's a brief overview of each part:

Main method: Displays the menu, reads user input, and calls the appropriate method based on the user's choice. It also handles the option to quit the program.
Helper methods: Separate methods are provided for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation). These methods prompt the user for input, perform the operation, and display the result.
Input handling: Uses a Scanner object to read user input from the console and ensures that invalid input is handled appropriately.
Error handling: Checks for division by zero and displays an error message if encountered.
Modularity: Each arithmetic operation is implemented in its own method, promoting code readability and maintainability.
